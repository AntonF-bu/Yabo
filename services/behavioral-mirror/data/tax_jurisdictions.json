    "notes": "50% capital gains inclusion rate — only half of gains are added to taxable income. Top combined federal+provincial rate varies by province (Ontario example: 53.53% marginal x 50% inclusion = 26.76% effective). Proposed increase to 66.67% inclusion was cancelled in 2025.",
    "quirks": "Canada's 50% inclusion rate means the effective tax rate is always half the marginal income tax rate. The proposed increase to 66.67% inclusion was cancelled by PM Carney in 2025, but the political risk remains — future governments may revisit. The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption of $1,250,000 on qualified small business shares is a powerful planning tool. No distinction between short-term and long-term holding periods."

    "notes": "Private capital gains on securities are tax-free. However, traders classified as 'professional' (gewerbsmassiger Wertschriftenhandler) are taxed at income tax rates (up to ~40% depending on canton).",
    "quirks": "Switzerland's zero capital gains tax only applies to private investors. Five criteria determine professional classification: holding period under 6 months, transaction volume exceeding 5x portfolio value per year, gains exceeding 50% of total income, use of leverage/margin, and significant use of derivatives. Crossing these thresholds triggers full income taxation at cantonal rates up to ~40%. This creates a hard behavioral ceiling — Swiss traders must carefully monitor their trading frequency and leverage use."
